The objective of the poroject was to learn the first movement of the Bruch violin concerto and to successfully perform it on stage. Aside from the practicing process, working in team with the concertmaster and the class teacher while making a solid interpretation of the piece was the key part of the project. The concerto perfomance was also followed by Prokofiev's famous "The dance of the knights" from the Romeo and Juliet ballet. A video of the perfomance cound be accesed via a link under the heading.
