## Scientific programming languages
Programming languages are used in different science fields for different purposes. First of all, they are quiete useful for many kinds of calculating and approximating algorithms. While writing such, usual languages like C, C++ or python could be used. But languages like Fortran are much more popular in scientific programming because they were developed for that purpose, and nowadays they include a great amout of libraries with different functions used in mathematics and engineering.

Functional programming languages are of special interest to maths and computer sciences as they are built on the mathematical definition of function rather than the infromatical one.
